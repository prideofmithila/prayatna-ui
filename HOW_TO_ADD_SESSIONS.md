## Troubleshooting Session Creation

### Session Won't Save
- Ensure **Session Name** is filled (Required field)
- Check all required fields are complete
- Look for error messages in red text
- Try again or refresh the page

### Tasks Aren't Showing
- Ensure tasks were added before saving
- Click "Save Task" button (not just closing modal)
- Tasks appear as cards after successful save

### Subtasks Disappeared
- Ensure "Has Subtasks" toggle was set to "Yes"
- Save each subtask individually
- Check that at least one subtask was added

### Can't Edit System-Generated Sessions
- This is intentional - system sessions are templates
- Click Edit to create and edit a personal copy
- Your copy will be independent and fully editable

### Session Lost After Browser Close
- **If signed in**: Sessions auto-save to account
- **If guest**: Sessions stored locally only
- **Solution**: Sign in to ensure sessions persist

## Next Steps

After creating a session:

1. **Review it** - Click on the session to view details
2. **Start the timer** - Click Play to begin study session
3. **Track progress** - Watch task and subtask progress in timer
4. **Edit as needed** - Modify based on actual time taken
5. **Duplicate** - Reuse successful session structures
6. **Share** - Tell others about helpful session templates (if feature available)
