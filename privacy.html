      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>BodhPrepIAS ("we", "our", "us") provides tools to plan and track focus sessions. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> If you sign in with Google, we receive your Google user ID, email, name, and avatar URL. We do not receive your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Session names, durations, timers, and actions you take in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Device/technical data:</strong> Basic logs (IP, browser type, pages viewed) for security and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and tokens:</strong> We use short-lived access tokens and optional refresh tokens to keep you signed in. Cookies used for auth are httpOnly and secure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and improve BodhPrepIAS's features (e.g., saving sessions, timers).</li>
        <li>Authenticate you and keep your account secure.</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse and ensure reliable service.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal Bases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To deliver the app’s features you request.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To keep the service secure and improve usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where required (e.g., analytics cookies if enabled).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

        <li><strong>Legal:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity of the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain account and session data for as long as your account is active. If you request deletion, we remove or anonymize your data within a reasonable period, subject to legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard measures such as HTTPS, least-privilege access, hashed refresh tokens, and regular updates. No method is 100% secure; we work continuously to improve protections.</p>
