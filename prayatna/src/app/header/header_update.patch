Update header to show user profile picture and name from ID token claims.

Changes needed:
1. In header.html line 42-43: Replace the Profile button with user picture/name display
2. In header.html line 48: Update the greeting to show full name with picture
3. In header.ts line 92-96: Add console logging to debug claims extraction

Current ID token includes:
- name: "prateek karna"  
- picture: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/..."
- email: "prateekkarna29@gmail.com"

The oauthService.getIdentityClaims() should already be extracting these fields.
